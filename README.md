*LolAnimals* is an app I built some years ago (in August 2010) while teaching myself Android programming. It's a very simple application that displays funny pictures of animals fetched from the [LolCats](http://icanhas.cheezburger.com/lolcats) website. It uses the open-source Jericho HTML parser library. The UI was crafted mostly by hand. Some features of the app include:

* ability to favorite pictures
* ability to save pictures to the device's internal storage/SD card.

LolAnimals has also been available on the Android market as a free download ever since it was developed.
